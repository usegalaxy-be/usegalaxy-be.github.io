        <p>A normal upgrade went awry and we had to restore some data from backup. We had a total downtime of around 20 hours.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">workflow_step_connection</code> table was partially corrupted as part of the
failed migration. It is likely that had we not tried to re-run upgrades, and
had not tried to manually apply the table changes, we could have prevented the
small loss of any new workflow connections created on Monday. We cannot say
this for certain, but it is probably. In the future we can do a lot to
safeguard against similar errors.</p>

<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

<p>We have planned since some time that we will have a test Galaxy where we can
test out these upgrades ahead of time, but unfortunately it has not been
possible to allocate time to this project, given the current priority/urgency
matrix. This task will be re-prioritised following this incident.</p>

<p>We will adjust our backup procedures before upgrades. Currently given the
extremely positive experiences and relative safety of database migrations in
the past years of running UseGalaxy.eu, we do not make backups before an
upgrade, and rely only on the normal daily backups. We will investigate the
possibility to trigger a backup immediately before any database changes, to
prevent similar issues in the future.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a significant interruption to our services for what should have been a
simple upgrade. We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused.</p>
