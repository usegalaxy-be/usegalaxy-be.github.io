DESCRIPTION:The Galaxy Training Network has developed an infrastructure to deliver interactive training based on Galaxy: one central place (<a href="https://training.galaxyproject.org">https://training.galaxyproject.org</a>) to aggregate training materials covering many current research topics. Each topic is supported by different tutorials developed and maintained by the community via a GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material">https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material</a>.\n\n<div class="multiple-img">  <img src="/assets/media/gtn_cofests.png" style="max-width: 500px; margin: 20px auto;" alt="GTN cofest logo" /></div>The Galaxy Training Network is organizing regular online CoFests (Collaboration/Contribution Fests) every 3 months on the 3rd Thursday for a day of the collaborative work on the training content.\n\n<strong>The next one will be on the 15th of November.</strong> We plan to focus on genome annotation training; but anyone who would like to contribute on any other topics is very welcome to join.We will coordinate via <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.459bpoqjjo780nm56q267ba7i8">Hangout</a> (drop-in channel we will keep open the whole day) and <a href="https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby">the GTN Gitter channel</a>.\n\nDuring the day, we plan to have a GTN meeting to discuss the recent changes and future directions.\n\n<hr /><em>If you want to join to help or to talk and learn about the project, let us know on the <a href="https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby">Gitter channel</a>.</em>\n\n<em>Bérénice and Saskia will be online between 9am and 6pm (CEST) but people from other time zones should feel welcome to continue even before/after. We will keep an eye on Gitter and GitHub</em>\n\n
