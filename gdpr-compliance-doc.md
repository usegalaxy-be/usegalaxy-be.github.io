## User Rights under the GDPR

And how to exercise them in the context of the Galaxy Service provided by the Galaxy Belgium Team and the Belgium Galaxy Community.

### Right to Access to Personal Information
The only personal information we store that is associated with you, you can see on [https://usegalaxy.be/user/information](https://usegalaxy.be/user/information) We have logs containing IP addresses but these logs are destroyed after 24 hours and are not associated with a single user account.

### Right to Rectification of Personal Information
You can do this on [https://usegalaxy.be/user/information](https://usegalaxy.be/user/information).

### Right to Erasure
We can manually delete your account upon request. In the future this will be something you can do yourself when we can implement the feature upstream.

### Right to Restrict Processing
All of the processing activities we currently do are required to use the service. We do not transmit any PII to third parties.

### Right to Data Portability
The upstream software Galaxy currently does not support this workflow, but does expose an interface that would allow us to do this. We are working on the implementation

### Right to Object
All of the processing activities we currently do are required to use the service. We do not transmit any PII to third parties. If we do processing activities in the future that do affect PII, we will inform you and permit you to opt-out.

### Right to Not be Subject to Automated Decision-making Including Profiling
We do not profile our users, nor do any form of automated decision making based on personal data.

## Terms of Service

### Use of Service
UseGalaxy.be is a free, public, Internet accessible resource (the “Service”). Data transfer is encrypted unless you choose to use unencrypted FTP access. Data storage is not encrypted. If there are restrictions on the way your research data can be stored and used, please consult your local institutional review board or the project principal investigator before uploading it to any public site, including this Service. If you have protected data, large data storage requirements, or short deadlines you are encouraged to set up your own local Galaxy instance and not use this Service. Your access to the service may be revoked at any time for reasons deemed necessary by the operators of the Service.

You acknowledge that you are responsible for compliance of all of your data processing activities carried out on the Galaxy Service with applicable laws and regulations of Belgium, the European Union as well as any laws or regulations of other legislations or any other restrictions that might be applicable due to the provenance, intended use, legal ownership of or any licensing or other legal restrictions imposed on the data being processed.

You are strictly prohibited from making use of the Galaxy Service for the storage or processing of any Personal Data or Sensitive Personal Data as defined by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including but not limited to potentially personally identifying medical data.

### Accounts and Service Limitations
You may choose to register an account with the Service. Your registration data is primarily used so you may persistently store data on the Service and use advanced Galaxy features such as sharing and workflows. The operators of the Service will not provide your registration data to any third party unless required to do so by law. Your access to the Service is provided under the condition that you abide by any published quotas on data storage, job submissions, or any other limitations placed on the public Service. Attempts to subvert these limits by creating multiple accounts or through any other method may result in termination of all associated accounts.

### Disclaimer
The Service is provided to you on an “AS IS” BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this service agreement.

### Limitation of Liability
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall VIB Data core, ELIXIR Belgium, VSC or any other entity which provides resources for the Service be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of the use of this Service including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
