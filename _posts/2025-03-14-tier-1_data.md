title: VSC Tier-1 Data as default storage backend 
tags: [change]
---

The default storage backend has been changed to [VSC Tier-1 Data](https://docs.vscentrum.be/data/tier1data/introduction.html), which is an iRODS backend with built-in data duplication. Ideally, you should not notice any differences when using useGalaxy.be like you are used to.   

If any errors or other oddity do occur, please report it to us directly via our support email <a href="mailto:datacore.galaxy@vib.be">datacore.galaxy@vib.be</a>.
